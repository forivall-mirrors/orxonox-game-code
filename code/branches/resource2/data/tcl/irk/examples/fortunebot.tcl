# fortunebot.tcl --
#
# Demo bot using the irc TCL client library. This is a VERY simple bot that
# demonstrates some simple uses of the irc TCL library.
#
# The bot sits on any number of channels and networks. It periodically grabs
# a fortune from a web site and sends the fortune with appropriate delays
# between each line to all channels on all networks it is on.

# Example use in Tcl:
#
# % source fortunebot.tcl
# % set token [irc::connect ....]
# % fortune::join $token #mychannel
# % fortune::start 120
#
# What this does:
# * Loads the bot, which in turn will load the IRC library and HTTP.
# * Connect to IRC
# * Send the bot to join #mychannel
# * Start the bot, with 120 seconds delay. Now it'll do its actions every
#   120 seconds.
#
# To stop the bot:
#
# % fortune::stop
#
# Make him leave a channel:
#
# % fortune::leave $token #mychannel
