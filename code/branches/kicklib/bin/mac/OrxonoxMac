#  Description:
#    Prepares the Mac OS X app for running orxonox
#

# TODO: Currently this script will only call the orxonox run script.
# But we actually need it to set the paths (eg. DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH) properly
# for otherwise, Orxonox won't run in an App Bundle. Other solution might be:
# to use install_name_tool at packaging time --> cleaner, but nasty to code.
../run
