/**
@file
@ingroup SingletonScope
@brief Declaration of the classes that are needed to use Scopes:
orxonox::Scope, orxonox::ScopeListener, and orxonox::ScopeManager.

@anchor Scope

A virtual scope can be represented by an instance of class orxonox::Scope. orxonox::Scope<@a scope> is a template
an its template argument defines the name of the virtual scope. See orxonox::ScopeID for an enumeration of the
available values for @a scope. The orxonox::Scope object for a given @a scope can be activated or deactivated.
Instances of orxonox::ScopeListener can register for a given @a scope and will get a notification if the
corresponding orxonox::Scope object changes its state.

To avoid multiple instances of orxonox::Scope<@a scope> in different libraries, each instance of orxonox::Scope
registers in orxonox::ScopeManager, where they are linked statically in the util library.

Scopes are usually used to control the creation and destruction of Singletons.
