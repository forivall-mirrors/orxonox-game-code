/**
    @file Clipboard.h
    @brief Some functions to exchange text between the OS clipboard and Orxonox.

    Use fromClipboard() to get text from the clipboard (if there is any text) and
    toClipboard(text) to put text into the clipboard.

    Those functions can only work properly if there's an OS-specific implementation.
    If an OS isn't supported, the clipboard only works within Orxonox, but exchange
    with other programs isn't possible.
