    This is the documentation of Orxonox. It contains descriptions of our classes and functions and
    explains their usage with several examples and background information. Because Orxonox is so big,
    we can't document all of our code - sorry for that! But we do your best to document the most
    important parts of it, namely the @ref Core "core" and @ref Util "util" libraries, as well as the
    central classes in the @ref Orxonox "orxonox" main library and some @ref Modules "modules".

    To understand the connection between different classes in Orxonox, have a look at the
    <a href="modules.html"><b>Modules section</b></a>. It contains a list of the most important topics
    and groups files that contribute to the same feature.
