    @brief Declaration of SmallObjectAllocator

    @anchor SmallObjectAllocatorExample

    The default implementations of new and delete are designed to work with objects of
    arbitrary size. They are thus not optimal for small objects.
    @ref orxonox::SmallObjectAllocator "SmallObjectAllocator" allocates a large memory
    block and divides it into small chunks. These chunks are returned by the function
    @ref orxonox::SmallObjectAllocator::alloc() "alloc()" and can be used to create a
    new object using the placement new operator. Instead of delete, the function
    @ref orxonox::SmallObjectAllocator::free() "free()" is used to give the memory
    back to SmallObjectAllocator.

    Example:
    @code
    SmallObjectAllocator allocator(sizeof(MySmallObject));  // Create an allocator. The size of the memory chunks must equal the size of the desired class

    void* chunk = allocator.alloc();                        // Allocate a memory chunk
    MySmallObject* object = new (chunk) MySmallObject();    // Call the placement new operator

    object->someFunction();                                 // Do something with the object

    object->~MySmallObject();                               // Call the destructor
    allocator.free(object);                                 // Free the allocated memory
    @endcode

    @b Important: You have to call the destructor of the object manually, because this
    is not automatically done by the allocator nor free().

    @note The destructor can be ignored if it is empty or not implemented. This saves
    another amount of time.

    @remarks For a distributed usage of SmallObjectAllocator it may be a good idea to
    create a static function that returns an instance to it. The allocator then works
    like a singleton and can be accesses from everywhere.
