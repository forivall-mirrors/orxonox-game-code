		Usage
..:: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- ::..

IMPORTANT: Link 'AddressBook.framework'
(available on the Mac-computer self) to
your project,
since this CMCrashReporter is using this.

1) Link the classes and the nib-file to your project.
2) link the addressbook.framework to your project (available on Mac OS Library)
3) At your main-class (preferable AppDelegate)
		import CMCrashReporter.h and call [CMCrashReporter check].

A good place to call this method is in -(void)applicationDidFinishLaunching: in your app delegate



	App Settings (info.plist)
..:: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- ::..

CMSubmitURL - String: HTTP-Path to commit the logs to (as POST-Data)
CMMaxReports (optional) - Int: max number of crashlogs to be sent

	Settings (Preferences)
..:: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- ::..
It's possible to let your users have a choice to submit reports, or just ignore them.

Create a NSCheckbox and link this to NSUserDefaults with 'CMCrashReporterIgnoreCrashes' as key.

 CMCrashReporterIgnoreCrashes - BOOL: let the user ignore crashreports
