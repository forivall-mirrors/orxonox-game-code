        @brief The Shell is the logical component of the console that displays output to the user and allows him to enter commands.

        The Shell gathers output sent from OutputHandler by inheriting from OutputListener.
        The output-lines are stored in the shell, so they can be displayed in a graphical
        console. Additionally the Shell has an InputBuffer which is needed by the user to
        enter commands.

        Different graphical consoles build upon a Shell, for example InGameConsole and IOConsole.
