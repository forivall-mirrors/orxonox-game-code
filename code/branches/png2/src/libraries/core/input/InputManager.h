    /**
    @brief
        Manages the input devices (mouse, keyboard, joy sticks) and the input states.

        Every input device has its own wrapper class which does the actually input event
        distribution. The InputManager only creates reloads (on request) those devices.

        The other functionality concerns handling InputStates. They act as a layer
        between InputHandlers (like the KeyBinder or the GUIManager) and InputDevices.
        InputStates are memory managed by the IputManager. You cannot create or destroy
        them on your own. Therefore all states get destroyed with the InputManager d'tor.
    @note
        - The actual lists containing all the InputStates for a specific device are stored
          in the InputDevices themselves.
        - The devices_ vector always has at least two elements: Keyboard (first) and mouse.
          You best access them internally with InputDeviceEnumerator::Keyboard/Mouse
          The first joy stick is accessed with InputDeviceEnumerator::FirstJoyStick.
        - Keyboard construction is mandatory , mouse and joy sticks are not.
          If the OIS::InputManager or the Keyboard fail, an exception is thrown.
