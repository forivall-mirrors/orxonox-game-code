    @brief
        GlobalQuests are Quests, that have the same status for all players.
        This means, that when a player successfully completes a GlobalQuest, it is completed for all players that have it.
        
        Creating a GlobalQuest through XML goes as follows:
        
        <GlobalQuest id="questId"> //Where questId is a GUID, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globally_Unique_Identifier#Basic_structure for more information
            <QuestDescription title="Title" description="Description." /> //The description of the quest.
            <subquests>
		<Quest id ="questId1" /> //A list of n subquest, be aware, each of the <Quest /> tags must have a description and so on and so forth as well.
		...
		<Quest id="questIdn" />
	    </subquests>
	    <hints>
		<QuestHint id="hintId1" /> //A list of n QuestHints, see QuestHint for the full XML representation of those.
		...
		<QuestHint id="hintIdn" />
	    </hints>
            <fail-effects>
                <QuestEffect /> //A list of QuestEffects, invoked on all players possessing this quest, when the Quest is failed, see QuestEffect for the full XML representation.
                ...
                <QuestEffect />
            </fail-effects>
            <complete-effects>
                <QuestEffect /> //A list of QuestEffects, invoked on all players possessing this quest, when the Quest is completed, see QuestEffect for the full XML representation.
                ...
                <QuestEffect />
            </complete-effects>
            <reward-effects>
                <QuestEffect /> //A list of QuestEffects, invoked on the player completing this quest. See QuestEffect for the full XML representation.
                ...
                <QuestEffect />
            </reward-effects>
        </GlobalQuest>
