    @brief
        Represents a hint in the game towards completing a Quest.
        Consists of title and description (which is stored in a QuestDescription object) in textual form and must belong to a quest.
        A QuestHint has a defined status (inactive or active, where inactive is default) for each player, which means each a QuestHint exists only once for all players, it doesn't belong to a player, it just has different states for each of them.
        
        Creating a QuestHint through XML goes as follows:
        
        <QuestHint id="hintId">  //Where hintId is a GUID, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globally_Unique_Identifier#Basic_structure for more information
            <QuestDesctription title="" description="" />
        </QuestHint>
