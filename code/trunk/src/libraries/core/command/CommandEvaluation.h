    @brief Declaration of the orxonox::CommandEvaluation class which is returned by orxonox::CommandExecutor::evaluate().

    The orxonox::CommandEvaluation class gathers all information about a command-string. It is used
    internally by orxonox::CommandExecutor and can also be returned by it to provide more information
    about a command. It's also possible to evaluate the arguments of a command to execute it faster.

    @see See @ref CommandExecutorExample "this description" for an example.

        @brief CommandEvaluation is used to gather information about a command and to evaluate its arguments

        This class provides several information about a command-string, for example the
        evaluated ConsoleCommand, but also other information like hints if the command
        is not yet finished.

        @note You don't have to call evaluateArguments() manually, it's also done automatically
        if you call the command the first time. However you can of course do it at any earlier
        time, for example to return an error message if it doesn't work.

        @remarks execCommand_ and hintCommand_ can be different in this case: There are multiple
        commands avaliable, let's say "tcl", "tclexecute", and "tclquery". The user enters
        "tcl", which is already a valid command. Now execCommand_ points to the "tcl"-command,
        but hintCommand_ still points to the autocompletion command of CommandExecutor, because
        the auto-completion list must still return the three possible commands, "tcl tclexecute tclquery"
        because the user may want to execute "tclquery" and needs auto-completion.

        @see See @ref CommandExecutorExample "this description" for an example.
