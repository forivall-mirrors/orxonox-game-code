 #  Description:
 #    Joins both resources.oxr files together
 #  Caution:
 #    Variables are declared with @...@ because they don't exist anymore
 #    during the installation. But we still require variables (_external_file)
 #    so we can only replace @...@ but not ${...}
 #

# Write some comment
FILE(APPEND @DATA_INSTALL_DIRECTORY@/resources.oxr "\n\n\n <!-- ---------------------------------------- -->")
FILE(APPEND @DATA_INSTALL_DIRECTORY@/resources.oxr     "\n <!-- Content from the external data directory -->")
FILE(APPEND @DATA_INSTALL_DIRECTORY@/resources.oxr     "\n <!-- ---------------------------------------- -->\n\n")

# Append the external file
FILE(READ   @EXTERNAL_DATA_DIRECTORY@/resources.oxr _external_file)
