The following is a high-level view of changes made to the system between releases.

All changes not related to the lua script module have been deleted!

Release 0.6.2
=============
Added: Support for TreeEventArgs in the lua scripting module (patch from kripken, http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=3704)
Added: Added ability to specify a function to be used as the error handler in calls to lua_pcall.  See: http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=239

Modified: Forward CEGUI::ScriptException from within the CEGUI::System script execution functions as opposed to translating them into less useful CEGUI::GenericException.  See: http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=3595

Bug Fix: Event connection objects returned to lua subscribeEvent calls did not have the connected or disconnect members available for use (making the connection object useless).
Bug Fix: Lua script module based 'executeScriptedEventHandler was still not returning correct value (missed when I did the LuaFunctor version of the same, see: http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=225 for original issue).
Bug Fix: ScriptModule bindings were destroyed out of sequence meaning event handlers could still be fired that needed CEGUI bindings to exist.  See: http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=245.
Bug Fix: The C++ side of the lua based event mechanism would always return true as if the event were handled, even if some other boolean value (i.e. false) were returned from the lua side.  See: http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=225


Release 0.6.1
=============
Modified: On linux, use installed system versions of tolua++ and TinyXML libraries if available (can be disabled to force continued use of internal versions).  See: http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=198

Bug Fix: Need to bring in CEGUIConfig.h when building CEGUILua.cpp in case we're on a Mac.
Bug Fix: uncomment part of cegui.lua configuration script that allows use of option to have Ogre in samples.
Bug Fix: tolua++cegui generator missing Lua_CFLAGS in autotools build.


Release 0.6.0
=============
Added: Levia's GroupBox to the Lua module.
Added: Warning log level to the Lua module.

Modified: tolua++cegui changes in exception handlers.

Bug Fix: Lua 5.1 removes table.setn - update code to use alternate method of ensuring table is indeed empty.
Bug Fix: Lua was not correctly detected on (K)Ubuntu type systems (http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=138)
Bug Fix: Support lua 5.1 in CEGUILua.cpp (not sure of generator status with 5.1) (http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=161)
Bug Fix: warnings of unused local variables in lua_CEGUI.cpp fixed.
Bug Fix: Fixed Memory Leak in Lua Scripting Module when it throws and helper object has already been created.


Release 0.5.0 (Final)
=====================
Added: Missing functions in WindowFactoryManager Lua bindings. Incomplete FalagardWindowMapping binding as well.
Added: Lua binding for OutStream: FileStream (minimal std::ofstream).
Added: XML writing function in Lua bindings.

Modified: Renamed tolua++bin/remake_pkg..bat to remove extra period


Release 0.5.0-RC2
=================
Modified: Removed static Makefile for tolua++cegui generator tool and switched to autotools style build, with enable/disable configure option, for tolua++cegui generator tool
Modified: Moved tolua++ into it's own dir, removed lua_and_tolua++
Modified: Externalised our use of the Lua library
Modified: LuaScriptModule public headers no longer need include lua.h included.

Bug Fix: Corrected some mistakes in the Falagard Lua bindings
Bug Fix: Lua bindings was missing ImagesetManager::createImagesetFromImageFile + some missing tolua_throws modifiers


Release 0.5.0-RC1
=================
CEGUI MK2 has moved to the MIT license.

Added: small script to recreate the binding generator for tolua++
Added: customized tolua++ binary. For exception handling support in generated binding code.
Added: Documentation for some of the new features in the bundled tolua++ generator.
Added: When subscribing to events from "inside" Lua a self object can be registered as well to be passed along with the EventArgs.
Added: Major update of the LuaScriptModule to support anonymous functions.
Added: Default resource group support to ScriptingModule, and implemented it's use in the CEGUILua module.
Added: Lots of missing members in the Lua bindings.
Added: bat files to make it easier for Windows users to regenerate the Lua bindings and tolua++cegui.

Modified: The "Lua and tolua++" module has been made a DLL on Windows machines.
Modified: In the lua module, updated Window with casting helpers as member functions. eg. w:toFrameWindow()
Modified: Updated to tolua++ 1.0.92
Modified: Moved LuaFunctor into its own files
Modified: Reimplemented the "late binding" effect from the v04 Lua module. In v04 the function is always looked up by name. In CVS HEAD the actual Lua function is referenced, but now this will only occur the first time the event is triggered. This means that it's no longer necessary to have a function defined to subscribe it to an event. As long as the function has been created before the event occurs everything will be good Smile
Modified: Moved subscribeScriptedEvent into ScriptModule to allow more customized script subscription functionality.
Modified: Removal of "tolua_outside" stuff that was no longer needed.
Modified: The script module now throws ScriptException.
Modified: The bundled tolua++cegui binding generator will now generate a lua_CEGUI.cpp that compiles out-of-the-box on Windows

Bug Fix: Bug in LuaScriptModule where executeScriptFile did not unload the file data buffer correctly in case of an exception (thanks gcarlton).

Modified: Lua scripting module renamed to CEGUILua (Win32 systems).

Bug Fix: Fixed some uint/ColourRect/String CEGUILua issues.
