************* Build System **************
To make platform support as easy as possible we have decided to use CMake as our build system.
Therefore the first thing you need to do is to get
CMake v.2.6 or later.

************** Libraries ****************

In order to compile Orxonox you will need the following libraries:
(for windows there are already precompiled packages on the website)

OGRE 3D Graphics Engine          1.4 (1.6 not yet supported)
