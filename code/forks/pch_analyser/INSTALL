************* Build System **************
To make platform support as easy as possible we have decided to use CMake as our build system.
Therefore the first thing you need to do is to get
CMake v.2.6 or later.

************** Libraries ****************

In order to compile this Orxonox sandbox you will need to install Qt 4.4 or higher
