    /**
    @brief
        The HealthPickup is a Pickupable that can do (dependent upon the parameters) lots of different things to the health of a Pawn.
        There are 5 parameters that can be chosen:
        - The @b activationType It can be chosen to be either <em>immediate</em> or <em>onUse</em>. The activation type essentially (as indicated by the name) defines when the health is transferred, either immediately after being picked up or only after the player uses it. The default is <em>immediate</em>.
        - The @b durationType It can be chosen to be either <em>once</em> or <em>continuous</em>. For <em>once</em> the specified health is transferred once to the Pawn, for <em>continuous</em> the set health is transferred over a span of time at a rate defined by the health rate parameter. The default is <em>once</em>.
        - The @b health The amount of health that (in a way dependent on the other parameters) is transferred to the Pawn. Default is 0.
        - The @b healthType The health type can be chosen to be <em>limited</em>, <em>temporary</em> or <em>permanent</em>. <em>limited</em> means that the health is increased only to the maximum health of the Pawn. 'temporary' means that the maximum health is temporarily elevated but will be set back as soon as the pickup is no longer in use. <em>permanent</em> means that the maximum health of the Pawn is increased such that the health provided by the pickup will fit in and the maximum health stays that way. The default is <em>limited</em>.
        - The @b healthRate If set to continuous, the health that is transferred per second is the <em>healthRate</em>. There is health transferred until the health set by <em>health</em> is depleted. The default is 0.

        An example of a XML implementation of a HealthPickup would be:
        @code
        <HealthPickup
            health = 33
            healthType = "limited"
            activationType = "immediate"
            durationType = "once"
        />
        @endcode
